# How to remove animation in Windows

To fix the issue with your taskbar not appearing promptly after turning on your PC, you can try restarting the `explorer.exe` process using the following steps:

1. **Press `Windows + R`** to open the Run dialog.
2. In the Run box, type `explorer.exe` and press **Enter**.
   - This will restart Windows Explorer, which controls the taskbar, Start menu, and other visual elements of Windows.
   - Once restarted, the taskbar should appear normally.

### Additional Steps (Optional)
If this doesn't work and you want to reset animations while keeping your PC smooth:

1. **Reduce Animations for Better Performance:**
   - Press `Windows + R` again, and type `sysdm.cpl`, then press **Enter**.
   - Go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Settings** under the **Performance** section.
   - In the **Performance Options** window, select **Custom**, and uncheck unnecessary animations, but keep essential ones like **"Show windows contents while dragging"** to maintain a balance between performance and usability.
   - Click **Apply** and **OK** to confirm.
