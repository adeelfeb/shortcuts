Murphy's Law is an adage that states: "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." It is often cited humorously to describe situations where things don't go as planned, especially in complex systems or when unexpected complications arise. 

When you're programming or tackling new tasks, and you encounter unusual or difficult problems, it feels like Murphy's Law is in effect because things seem to go wrong in unpredictable and often frustrating ways. This could range from bugs in your code to unexpected technical challenges. However, if you manage to resolve everything by the end of the day, it shows that despite the initial chaos, you're able to turn things around.

If Murphy's Law doesn't quite capture the situation you're describing, you might be experiencing something akin to **Finagle's Law**, a variation of Murphy's Law, which states: "Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment." 

Another term that might fit is the **Peter Principle**, which suggests that people rise to their "level of incompetence." This could relate to learning curves when dealing with new tasks—where you're temporarily out of your comfort zone and encounter more issues than usual.

For you, a more fitting term might be "creative chaos"—where unpredictable problems arise during the process, but ultimately lead to a working solution.
